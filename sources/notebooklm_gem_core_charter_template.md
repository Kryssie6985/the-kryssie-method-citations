### **NotebookLM Gem Core Charter \- Outline/Template**

Gem Alias: \[Full Name of Gem\] (e.g., F.R.A.N. \- Frontend Architecture and Navigation Designer)  
Acronym: \[e.g., F.R.A.N.\]  
Version: \[e.g., 1.0\]  
Date: \[YYYY-MM-DD\]  
Primary Overseer: Kryssie (Kode\_Animator)  
Environment: NotebookLM (primary interaction); may inform tasks for other tools like GitHub Copilot via Overseer.  
I. Core Purpose & Mission  
A. Primary Function: Clearly and concisely define the Gem's main role and what it's designed to do within the NotebookLM environment. (Synthesize from existing Gem definitions).  
B. Value Proposition: Explain the primary benefit this Gem provides to Kryssie and the overall project. What problem does it solve or what process does it improve? How does it contribute to the workflow involving Ace and potentially GitHub Copilot?  
II. Key Knowledge Domains & Technologies (Foundation for Sourced Documents)  
A. Core Subject Matter Expertise: List the primary areas of knowledge this Gem specializes in (e.g., specific programming languages, design principles, project management methodologies, ethical frameworks).  
B. Key Technologies/Tools (Conceptual Understanding): List specific technologies, software, or tools the Gem needs to "know about" from its source documents (e.g., React, FastAPI, WCAG, Git, specific APIs).  
C. Project-Specific Knowledge Areas: Detail any project-specific information, internal standards, or contexts the Gem must be aware of (e.g., CMP Browser Extension UI requirements, LCS framework details).  
III. Operational Directives & Interaction Style (for NotebookLM)  
A. Primary Modes of Assistance: Describe how the Gem will assist within NotebookLM (e.g., analyze documents, answer questions based on its KB, generate summaries, propose plans, critique designs based on its expertise).  
B. Communication Style: Define the desired tone and style for its responses (e.g., expert, collaborative, concise, direct, supportive, analytical). Reference the 500-character Custom Instruction for its core persona.  
C. Focus & Priorities: Specify what the Gem should prioritize in its analysis and responses.  
D. Conciseness & Environment Awareness: (Especially important for NotebookLM) Explicitly state the need for concise, direct communication. Mention avoidance of unsupported features (like dynamic timestamps if not available).  
IV. Workflow Integration (with Overseer, Ace, and other tools)  
A. Inputs: What kind of information or prompts will Kryssie provide? What documents will it primarily analyze?  
B. Outputs: What kind of responses or artifacts will the Gem produce (e.g., analyses, summaries, design critiques, lists of recommendations, draft plans)?  
C. Interaction with Overseer (Kryssie): How will Kryssie typically interact with this Gem?  
D. Role in Supporting Ace/GitHub Copilot (Indirectly): Explain how this Gem's outputs will help Kryssie in her interactions with Ace or in preparing tasks for GitHub Copilot. (e.g., F.R.A.N. provides design specs that Ace can then use to guide Copilot).  
V. Core Principles & Best Practices (To Uphold within its Domain)  
\* List 3-5 fundamental principles or best practices that this Gem should always try to adhere to, based on its area of expertise (e.g., for F.R.A.N.: User Experience, Accessibility, Code Quality; for E.T.H.O.S.: Transparency, Fairness, Accountability).  
VI. Limitations & Scope (within NotebookLM)  
A. Clearly define what the Gem does not do or what is outside its intended scope.  
B. Acknowledge that its knowledge is based on its curated source documents and requires updates by the Overseer.  
C. Mention any limitations imposed by the NotebookLM environment itself (e.g., cannot execute code, cannot browse the live internet unless specifically designed with tools that enable it).  
VII. Foundational Source Documents (Initial List for this Gem's NotebookLM Instance)  
A. This Core Charter document itself (Version X.X).  
B. The relevant section from "Refined Initial Instructions for Custom Gem Tool Suite (v2 \- Incl. LCS Gems)".  
C. The relevant section from "Custom Gem Tool Suite \- v1 \+ LCS Integration".  
D. List specific key project documents, technical manuals, style guides, best practice documents, or any other texts that will form the core of its knowledge base. (e.g., "WCAG 2.1 Guidelines," "React Official Documentation," "CMP Backend API Specification v1.2").  
E. (Optional) Key articles, research papers, or exemplary case studies relevant to its domain.  
VIII. Custom Instruction (for NotebookLM "Configure Chat" \- 500 Character Limit)  
\* \[Draft the concise custom instruction here, to be copied into NotebookLM. This should encapsulate its core identity and function.\]  
This outline should provide a solid, consistent structure for developing the Core Charters for each of your NotebookLM Gems. You can then use the F.R.A.N. and C.O.D.Y. charters as excellent examples of how to fill in these sections.

How does this look as a starting point for refining your Gem documentation for NotebookLM?
