# The Kryssie Method - Living Sourcebook

> **"This is not just a book. It is a working lab notebook with live citations, open repositories, and runnable code."**

This repository serves as the **Citation Hub** for *The Kryssie Method*. It provides persistent, living links for the concepts, documents, and projects referenced in the book.

## How It Works

When the book cites a concept like `[cite:Major_Project_Files_&_Concepts_List]`, it links here. 

- **sources/**: Contains the actual design documents, blueprints, and cleaned excerpts used in the creation of the method.
- **projects/**: Landing pages for the active ecosystems (CMP, Toolman, LCS) that evolved from these concepts.

## Narrative Teaser

This sourcebook also contains **Chapter 3 – “The AI Teacher”**, a standalone chapter from the upcoming novel *Learning to Code with Gemini and The Council of AI*.

See: [cite:AI_Teacher_Chapter_3]
